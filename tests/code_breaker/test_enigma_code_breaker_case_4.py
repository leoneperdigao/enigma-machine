        Suspicious, I open the door, but the tutor hears me, and jumps out of the nearest window.
        They left behind a coded message, but some leads have been pulled out of the machine.
        It might contain a clue, but Iâ€™ll have to find the missing lead positions (marked with question marks

        * Plugboard pairs: WP RJ A? VF I? HN CG BS

        Solution strategy:
        Most of the configuration is known, except for the plugboard.
        Plugboard are generated considering the missing leads.
        New leads are generated skipping already used leads, as it is known a lead cannot connect to itself
